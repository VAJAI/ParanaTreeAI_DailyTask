1. Zero-Shot Prompting
Definition: The model is given a task without any prior examples or context.

Use Cases:

When you want the model to generalize based on its training.
Tasks like summarization, translation, or classification.
Example Prompt:
"Translate the following sentence to French: 'The weather is nice today.'"

Advantages:

Simple to implement.
Good for straightforward tasks.
Disadvantages:

May not perform well on complex or ambiguous tasks without additional context.
2. Few-Shot Prompting
Definition: A few examples are provided in the prompt to demonstrate the task.

Use Cases:

When the task requires more context or a specific pattern.
Useful for tasks like sentiment analysis or creative writing.
Example Prompt:

rust
Copy code
Sentiment Analysis Examples:  
1. "I love this product!" -> Positive  
2. "This is the worst service ever." -> Negative  
3. "I think it's okay." -> Neutral  
Analyze the sentiment of this sentence: "The food was fantastic!"
Advantages:

Improves accuracy for nuanced or subjective tasks.
Helps the model mimic specific output patterns.
Disadvantages:

Prompts can become lengthy and consume more tokens.
May still struggle with edge cases.
3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Definition: Encourages the model to reason step-by-step before providing an answer.

Use Cases:

Logical reasoning, arithmetic problems, or complex Q&A.
Example Prompt:


Question: If a train travels 60 km in 1 hour, how far will it travel in 2.5 hours?  
Reason step by step:  
- The train travels 60 km in 1 hour.  
- In 2 hours, it will travel 60 x 2 = 120 km.  
- In 0.5 hours, it will travel 60 x 0.5 = 30 km.  
- Total distance = 120 + 30 = 150 km.  
Answer: 150 km
Advantages:

Boosts performance on tasks requiring logical deductions.
Reduces errors for multi-step problems.
Disadvantages:

Longer response time due to detailed reasoning.
Not ideal for tasks requiring brief answers.
