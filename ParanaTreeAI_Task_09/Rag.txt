What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework designed to improve the performance of language models by combining two components: retrieval and generation. This system is particularly effective for answering user questions or performing tasks that require external knowledge not contained in the language model itself.


Key Concepts of RAG
 *****  Why RAG?

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT are trained on vast datasets but have a cutoff date and limited capacity to recall specific or up-to-date knowledge.
RAG bridges this gap by retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base before generating a response.
How RAG Works:

Retriever: 
          Finds relevant context (e.g., documents, passages) from a pre-built knowledge base.
Generator: 
         Uses this retrieved information along with the query to generate accurate and context-aware answers.


RAG Components in Detail
1. Retriever
        Role: Finds the most relevant documents or data from an external knowledge base.
How It Works:
            Data is stored as vector embeddings in a vector database (like Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS).
            When a user asks a question, the query is also converted into an embedding, and the system retrieves the closest matches using similarity search.
Tools Used:
           Embedding models (e.g., text-embedding-ada-002).
           Vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate).

2. Generator
         Role: Produces human-like text based on the retrieved information and user query.
How It Works:
            Takes the retrieved documents as input, along with the original user query.
            Generates an answer by combining the provided context and the LLMâ€™s reasoning capabilities.
Tools Used:
          Large Language Models (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-3.5).
3. Integrator
        Role: Combines and presents the retriever's output with the generator's response in a cohesive way.
Purpose: Ensures the generated response is relevant, factual, and easy to understand.
