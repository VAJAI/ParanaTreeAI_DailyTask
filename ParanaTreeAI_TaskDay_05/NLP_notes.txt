What is NLP (Natural Language Processing)?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a meaningful way. It bridges the gap between human language (natural language) and machine language.

Why is NLP Important?
1. Human-Computer Interaction: It helps computers understand and respond to human language, making them more accessible (e.g., chatbots, voice assistants like Alexa or Siri).

2. Data Insights: Extract meaningful patterns and insights from unstructured text data (e.g., reviews, emails, documents).

3. Automation: Automates tasks like translation, summarization, and sentiment analysis.


What is Text Processing?
Text processing is the foundation of NLP. It involves converting raw text into a structured format that a machine can analyze and process effectively. This includes breaking down the text, cleaning it, and transforming it into a usable format.


Basic Steps in Text Processing
Text Cleaning:

Remove unnecessary characters (punctuation, special symbols, etc.).
Convert text to lowercase.
Remove stop words (common words like "the," "is," "and").
Handle missing data or spelling errors.

Tokenization:

Splitting the text into smaller units like words or sentences.
Example: "NLP is fun!" → ["NLP", "is", "fun"]
Stemming and Lemmatization:

Stemming: Reduce words to their root form (e.g., "playing" → "play").

Lemmatization: Similar to stemming but ensures the word is meaningful (e.g., "better" → "good").
Vectorization:

Convert text into numbers (since machines work with numerical data).
Example: Using Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings like Word2Vec.


Examples of NLP in Action
Text Classification: Categorizing text into predefined labels (e.g., spam detection).
Sentiment Analysis: Understanding if a text conveys positive, negative, or neutral emotions.
Machine Translation: Translating one language into another (e.g., Google Translate).
Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: Answering queries using natural language.
Summarization: Condensing large amounts of text into key points.

The sentiment scores are printed to the console:

Polarity Example:
Positive: "I love this" → Polarity = 0.5
Neutral: "It is a table" → Polarity = 0.0
Negative: "I hate this" → Polarity = -0.8
Subjectivity Example:
"The sky is blue" → Subjectivity = 0.1 (objective)
"I feel happy" → Subjectivity = 0.9 (subjective)
